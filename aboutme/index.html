    <h2>Anani Sam</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Anani Sam and I'm from Ghana. I love to swim, draw and do creative things. I'm a High School Teacher and studying to gain more knowledge and skills to improve myself. </p>
    <p>I have chosen the technology path and studying for a degree in Software Development. What I love about BYU-Idaho is the practical hands-on training they give their students. So I believe taking a course in web design will equip me with the skill to be able to develop dynamic, data-driven applications that are good-looking and follow industry standards.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for sixteen years. It's been such a blessing to me.</p>
    <p>I'm looking forward to getting to know all of you. Many Thanks.</p>
